            <h3>RandFourBoost</h3>

            <p><b>What problem it Solves</b></p>

            <p>
                RandFourBoost addresses a common challenge faced by beginner music producers:
                identifying whether their music aligns with the intended genre. Beginners often
                struggle to recognize genre-specific characteristics, which can result in tracks
                that drift away from the genre they aim to create. This system helps provide
                guidance by predicting the genre of a track, allowing producers to evaluate
                whether their music is on the right track.
            </p>

            <p><b>Technologies Used</b></p>

            <p>
                The system was developed using Python, with machine learning models implemented
                through the scikit-learn library. The application is planned to be deployed using
                Flask as a backend framework, allowing the model to be accessed through a web-based
                interface for user interaction.

            <h3>A Web-Based System for Agricultural Data Monitoring, Yield Estimation, and Reporting</h3>

            <p><b>What Problem It Solves</b></p>

            <p>
                This system addresses the challenge of managing and analyzing agricultural data efficiently.
                In many cases, farmer records, farm sizes, and crop yield information are stored manually or
                across multiple sources, making it difficult to monitor production and generate accurate
                reports. This system centralizes agricultural data, allowing administrators to easily track
                farmers, monitor farm sizes, estimate crop yields, and view production statistics to support
                better planning and decision-making.
            </p>

            <p><b>Technologies Used</b></p>

            <p>
                The system was developed using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the
                frontend interface, with Bootstrap used for responsive design. Data visualization is handled
                using Chart.js to display production statistics and trends. The system connects to a backend
                through a REST API, with data processing and management handled by a server built using
                Node.js and Express.

            <h3>Lyrics to Powerpoint</h3>

            <p><b>What Problem It Solves</b></p>

            <p>
                Lyrics to PowerPoint is a tool I created to make it easier to generate presentation slides
                for our church during praise and worship lineups. Previously, creating these slides required
                manually copying and pasting each line of lyrics into PowerPoint, which was time-consuming
                and repetitive. This project streamlines the process by automatically organizing lyrics into
                slides, allowing presentations to be created faster and more efficiently.
            </p>

            <p><b>Technologies Used</b></p>

            <p>
                The system was developed using Python, which was used to handle the core logic and functionality
                of the project. Python was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for
                processing data and automating tasks within the application.
